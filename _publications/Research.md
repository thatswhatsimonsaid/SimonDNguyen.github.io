title: "Using Rashomon Sets for Robust Active Learning"
---

Collecting labeled data for training machine learning models is often costly and time-consuming. Active learning addresses these constraints by adaptively and strategically selecting the most informative observations for labeling. However, the current active learning literature does not account for model ambiguity and the possibility that several near-optimal models may fit the data well, a phenomenon termed the Rashomon Effect. When selecting the most informative candidate observation for labelling, the Rashomon Effect may suggest different candidate observations. Which observation, then, should an analyst query?

In this work, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, that addresses both this predictive multiplicity and the core issue of model ambiguity. Our approach enumerates the Rashomon set of near-optimal models and weights the selection metric by the posterior model probability. We then select the observation with the highest uncertainty from any model in the Rashomon set, embodying a conservative, ambiguity-averse strategy. This ensures a "best worst case" decision-making process restricted to the most plausible models, providing a robust method for selecting informative observations under model uncertainty. We term this procedure $\textit{Rashomon Restricted Ambiguity Averse Active Learning (RRAA-AL)}$.

title: "Optimal full matching under a new constraint on the sharing of controls"
---

Health policy researchers are often interested in the causal effect of a medical
treatment in situations where randomization is not possible. Full matching on the
propensity score (Gu & Rosenbaum, 1993) aims to emulate random assignment by
placing observations with similar estimated propensity scores into sets with either one
treated unit and one or more control units or one control unit and multiple treated
units. Sets of the second type, with treatment units forced to share a comparison unit,
can be unhelpful from the perspective of statistical efficiency. The sharing of controls
are often needed to achieve experiment-like arrangements, but optimal full matching is
known to exaggerate the number of many-one matches that are necessary, generating
lopsided matched sets and smaller effective sample sizes (Hansen, 2004).

In this work, we introduce an enhancement of the Hansen and Klopfer (2006) optimal
full matching algorithm that counteracts this exaggeration by enabling analysis to
permit treatment units to share a control while limiting the number that are permitted
to do so. The result is a more well-balanced matching structure that prioritizes 1 : 1
pairs as opposed to matches with lopsided, many-to-one configurations of matched sets.
This enhanced optimal full matching is then illustrated in a pilot study on the effects of
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) for treatment of pediatric acute
respiratory distress syndrome. Within this data-scarce pilot study, the existing methods
for limiting the sharing of controls have already resulted in an increased effective sample
size. The present enhancement of Hansen and Klopferâ€™s optimal full matching algorithm
provides an additional benefit to both effective sample size and covariate balance
