I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am fortunate to be advised by [Tyler H. McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/).

My current research focuses on interpretability in machine learning, specifically with a focus on the Rashomon effect and the role of human input in active learning systems that learn efficiently while offering diverse, transparent, and interpretable explanations.

Before joining UW, I earned my Masterâ€™s in Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I worked on causal inference under the guidance of [Ben B. Hansen](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/bbh.html). As part of the [Statistics Bridge Master's Program](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/bridge-stats-masters-program.html), I remain grateful to have been supported by the [Rackham Merit Fellowship](https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/rackham-merit-fellowship-program/).


In Summer 2025, I was a *Data Science Intern* the [Center for Naval Analyses (CNA)](https://www.cna.org/), where I worked on predictive maintenance for Navy aircrafts and ships and an LLM-powered tactical decision advisor for wargaming simulations.


**Summer 2026:** I am seeking internship opportunities in *data science and applied machine learning*, with a focus on bridging research and real-world decision making in areas such as AI interpretability, defense analytics, and responsible applied science.
