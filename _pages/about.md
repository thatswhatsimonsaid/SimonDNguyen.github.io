I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. I am fortunate to be advised by [Tyler H. McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/). 

Previously, I was a Masterâ€™s student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, studying causal inference and advised by [Ben B. Hansen](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/bbh.html). I was part of the second cohort to graduate from the department's [Bridge Master's Program](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/bridge-stats-masters-program.html) and remain grateful to have been supported by the [Rackham Merit Fellowship](https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/rackham-merit-fellowship-program/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning and causal inference. My current research focuses on predictive multiplicity and the diverse set of explanations originating from the Rashomon Set.
